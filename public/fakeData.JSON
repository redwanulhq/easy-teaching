In this course, Linux System Security LPIC-2, you will learn the foundational knowledge of securing your Linux server, giving you the opportunity to block threats before they turn into attacks. First, you will learn how to create and manage routers and route tables on your network, isolating servers from internet threats. Next, you will discover the skills behind firewalling your networks, allowing clients access with NAT, and access to servers using port forwarding. Finally, you will explore how to asses weaknesses in your OS with OpenVAS and detect intruders with the Snort IDS. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of security needed to protect your networks and Linux servers."

The idea of a VLAN is simply that an administrator has the ability to configure a switch such that there are multiple broadcast domains enabled, and inter-broadcast domain communication is not allowed. Effectively, a VLAN is a broadcast domain. In this course, VLAN Operation and Configuration, you will cover all things VLAN related. First, you will examine VLANs, VLAN trunks, the layer 3 switch. Next, you will set up a problematic network, and make errors during configuration. Finally, you will examine both how the network will behave and how to repair broken networks. After completing this course, you will be ready to segment a network with a single switch using VLANs."
